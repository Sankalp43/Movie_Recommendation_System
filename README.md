In this project, we are going to make a movie Recommendation system.
For this first we'll collect the movies data. Which includes cast, directors, genre and many other attributes of data.
After this, we'll do some data pre-processing to remove glitches like null values in data.
All the data we have is in textual form.
To process this data, we need to convert this data into numerical values.
For this we'll convert textual data into feature vectors.
This process is called feature extraction.
After that we'll find the similarity score or similarity confidence score between movies that means which movie is more or less similar to another movie.
After this we'll ask the user to input the name of movie and based on this movie, we'll show them which movie they can watch.
This can be done by using cosine similarity algorithm. You can learn more about this algorithm here [ https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/cosine/]. 
And finally, we will suggest the user, movies according to their interest.
